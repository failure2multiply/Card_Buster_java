Simple Java code for interim practical assessment.


Exercise 1:

You have been asked to develop a new computer game called, Card Busters!!!
There are two players playing the game. 
Both players are given seven cards each.
Here are the values of player one’s cards.
10,6,8,9,7,12,7
Here are the values of player two’s cards.
7,6,9,5,2,8,11
There are seven rounds in the game. 
Each round, the value of the players’ cards for that particular round are compared to see who has the highest valued card. The
player with the highest value card wins the round.
For example, in round 1, player one will play a card with a value of 10. Player two will
play a card with a value of 7. Player one wins the round.
If both cards have the same value, it is a tie.
At the end of the game (after seven rounds), the program should determine which
player has won the game overall (won the most rounds) or if the game has ended in a
tie.
